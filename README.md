The goal of this project is to solve an eight-puzzle using search algorithms. Specifically we will be using the blind search algorithm, Uniform Cost Search (Dijkstra), and the heuristic search algorithm A*, using two different heuristic functions. The application contains a series of unit tests as well as a main application driver with a command line interface for creating and solving an eight puzzle problem.



## Usage

To run the app, simply run the following command from the project root:

```bash
python main.py
```

To run the app tests, run:

```
python main.py --test
```

or

```
python main.py -t
```

To run the app and tests at the same time, run:

```
python main.py --test --continue
```

or

```
python main.py -t -c
```
