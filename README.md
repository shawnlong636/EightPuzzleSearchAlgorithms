# Eight Puzzle Project

The goal of this project is to solve an eight-puzzle using search algorithms. Specifically we will be using the blind search algorithm, Uniform Cost Search (Dijkstra), and the heuristic search algorithm A*, using two different heuristic functions. The application contains a series of unit tests as well as a main application driver with a command line interface for creating and solving an eight puzzle problem.
